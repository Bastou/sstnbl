We all share and use the web, just as we all share and live on this planet. This manifesto is a public declaration of a shared commitment to create a [sustainable internet](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-for-sustainability/9781491935767/ch01.html).

## We need a sustainable internet

The planet is experiencing unprecedented climate change and the Internet is both part of the problem and the solution. From websites to cryptocurrencies, the Internet consumes large amounts of electricity in data centres, telecoms networks, and end user devices. If the Internet was a country, it would be the **6th largest polluter** in the world and is expected to grow *considerably* by 2030.

If we embrace sustainability in our work, we can create a web that is good for people and planet. By signing this manifesto you declare your commitment to create a greener web.

```javascript
var text = "2-3";
// this is a command
function myCommand() {
  let counter = 0;
  counter++;
}

// Test with a line break above this line.
console.log("Test");
```
